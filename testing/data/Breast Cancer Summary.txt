Some background on the data

From paper Using Resistin, glucose, age and BMI to predict the presence of breast cancer, https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12885-017-3877-1

The goal of this exploratory study was to develop and assess a prediction model which can potentially
be used as a biomarker for breast cancer, based on anthropometric data and parameters which can be gathered in
routine blood analysis.

For each of the 166 participants several clinical features were observed or measured, including

Age
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Glucose
Insulin
HOMA (The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), based on plasma levels of fasting glucose and insulin, has been widely validated and applied for quantifying insulin resistance and Î²-cell function)
Leptin (A hormone predominantly made by adipose cells that helps to regulate energy balance by inhibiting hunger)
Adiponectin (A protein hormone which is involved in regulating glucose levels as well as fatty acid breakdown)
Resistin (An adipocyte-secreted hormone (adipokine) linked to obesity and insulin resistance in rodents)
MCP-1 (Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and macrophages to areas of inflammation)
